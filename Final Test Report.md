| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | High|
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score |High |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Verify that the Word Puzzle Game Plus functions correctly across its key features.
- Validate risk mitigation through functional, usability, and data-persistence testing.
- Ensure leaderboard data integrity and accurate scoring/bonus behavior.


### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of gameplay flow, score updates, hint deduction, reset, and leaderboard.
- Risk analysis coverage for data storage and bonus round logic.
- Manual testing in Chrome browser (desktop view).

**Out of Scope:**
- Mobile browser responsiveness testing.
- Automated testing and performance benchmarks.

### Tools & Resources

- Browser DevTools (Chrome)
- VS Code for inspection and debugging
- GitHub for version control and defect tracking
- Manual test documentation in Markdown

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|----------|------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| R1 | Reset Game | Game state may not reset all variables (e.g., solved count, hints used). | Medium | High | **High** | Validate full variable reset; include regression test before sign-off. |
| R2 | Leaderboard | Scores not stored persistently in `localStorage` or incorrect top-3 sorting. | High | High | **Critical** | Test with multiple score inputs; verify persistence after reload. |
| R3 | Bonus Round | Bonus trigger may misfire (not doubling after 3rd puzzle). | Medium | Medium | **High** | Test arithmetic and event sequencing; verify with boundary values (2, 3, 4). |
| R4 | Hint System | Hint deduction not applied properly or can be reused without penalty. | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Track score before/after using hint; validate hint reusability logic. |
| R5 | Input Validation | Empty input or mixed-case answers may cause false negatives. | High | Medium | **High** | Include negative test cases; normalize input before comparison. |
| R6 | UI Responsiveness | On smaller screens, layout or buttons overlap. | Medium | Low | **Medium** | Use Chrome mobile emulator to validate responsive design. |


### Risk Coverage

- Tested Risks Percent: 83% (5 of 6 tested)  
- Untested Risks Percent: R6 (UI responsiveness ‚Äì deferred)
